# AmazonLex
The project tries to integrate the AWS Lex with the AWS Lambda in order to create a simple bot that helps to convert the echange rates.

## API
I have made use of the currency layer api in order to obtain the exchange rates.

## TODOS:
- Obtain the api key for currency layer and replace the ACCESS_KEY with it in the lambda_function.py and views.py.
- Add the congnito credentials in the index.html file
